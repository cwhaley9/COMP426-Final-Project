# Weather App
Our Angular application utilizes a sqlite database to register users and a 3rd party API to display relevant weather information to each user. It does this by storing a 'favorite' city as a User SQL field. The app authenticates users and allows them to log out or delete their account while authenticated. The app also deals with incorrect usernames/passwords and duplicate usernames (because usernames are unique). 

You can run the application using: npm run start:both
